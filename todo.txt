Todo List for this project:
1. complete the logic for checking if the endpoint is present in the database, if it is present then check if the data of the endpoint is same as previous.
2. if it is different or it is not present then show the user a message to add/update the endpoint.
3. show all the websites and endpoints on the main website.
4. change the schema of the website endpoint.
